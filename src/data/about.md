# Once Upon a Time...
- I was born in a small village and moved to Zixing, Hunan Province when I was one year old. Zixing is a very peaceful and scenic tourist town, home to the breathtaking Dongjiang Lake. [See some pictures here](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&sca_esv=d1df69ed15318afd&sxsrf=AHTn8zoDjAmviiK_L1aRRa8OGVMIj1_Esg:1739215900291&q=dongjiang+lake&udm=2&fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpA-dk4wpBWOGsoR7DG5zJBjnSuuKZNj-6zieDk_gkn6DL72A7ut7DhWF7xFwTndjmJARkDooRNVvu4Aja6Pa3bifj4CXaS_3qi-N-j6yIDSB4lfcn8z6rxQMK6MvJ30Y82w6s6ltXvSdnDRiacHrIKvwFSbh7w69xtizlPoOYEEbvgsIy3jzg0WkFg5k6_wWcTs8EWw&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiTu7KP7LmLAxULOTQIHXWMLwYQtKgLegQIExAB&biw=819&bih=414&dpr=2.5).

- From 2016 to 2020, I spent four years in Beijing for my undergraduate studies. This vast, historical city was truly impressive. The Summer Palace was my favorite spot, where the sunset views are particularly [spectacular](https://www.google.com/search?q=summer+palace+sunset+images).

- In 2020, I started my master's journey in Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ and lived in Shanghai for two years. It was here that I met many inspiring mentors and friends, and began my path in quantitative marketing. My favorite secret spot in Shanghai is [Xinhua Road](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Xinhua+Road+Residential+District,+Changning+District,+Shanghai,+China,+200031/@31.2070383,121.412792,14.33z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x35b265408d47c867:0x6f051d7525fb7586!8m2!3d31.205077!4d121.426252!16s%2Fg%2F11c2qtwqfz?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIwNS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). It's a quiet, tree-lined street with many hidden gems - my #1 recommended place for a city walk in Shanghai.

- In 2022, I moved to Vancouver, and it became my second home as I began pursuing my Ph.D. in Quantitative Marketing at UBC. This multicultural city captivates me in every season, even during its famous "Rain-couver" days. I am very grateful to continue my academic journey in such a beautiful place, embraced by breathtaking scenery and amazing people.

# Fun Facts

- I love coffee, but not for the caffeine -- a cup of pour-over decaf is my morning ritual.
